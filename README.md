### Hi, I'm Praba! 👋🏼

 If you are reading this means you are looking me up! Thanks for that. Let me give you quick info on myself. I'm a Frontend Engineer @ <a href="https://www.freshworks.com/" target="_blank">Freshworks</a>. I am a Javascript defender in an argument and I believe in **Atwood's law** - 
 
 **`"Any application that can be written in Javascript will eventually be written in Javascript"`**
